 * PROGRAM EXECUTION CONTROL MODULE

 * and execution entry points. It handles the distinction between
 * running a file as main program versus importing it as a extension.
 * 
 * Essential for creating reusable extensions that can also serve
 * as executable scripts.

     * This function serves as an entry point controller. When
     * the containing file is executed directly (as the main
     * program), it calls the provided function. When the file
     * is imported as a extension, the function is not called.

     * variable-length positional arguments (*args) and

     * @param kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the function
     * @throws: TypeError if target function doesn't have correct signature
